A software application that keeps track of the pet’s activities and reports anomalous behavior of the pet to owner via mobile app. 

Abstract:
The increase in the computational power of computers has made it possible to capture important information, make use of the context and interact directly with the physical object. The IoT provides a set of standards and methodologies to associate an object in the real world. In our project, the proposed device will help the dog owners to keep an activity track on their pet remotely via webcam and feed them by just clicking a button or setting regular intervals for food dispense. It will also send the notifications to the owner whenever the dog behaves abnormally like excessive barking and thus fulfilling the need of the customers by letting owners leave their pets at home without any worries and let them take care of their pet's food requirements while they are not home.
