Project Proposal #1
Title: Automated pet surveillance 
Project idea Description: The common problem that every dog owner faces is how to take care of their dog pets while they are not home. Most of the times the dogs start showing anxiety issues when they have left home alone and tend to show abnormal behaviors like chewing furniture, continuous barking, etc. The proposed device will help the dog owners to keep an activity track on their pet remotely via webcam and feed them by just clicking a button or setting regular intervals for food dispense. The device will send the notifications to the owner whenever the dog behaves abnormally. Abnormal behaviors like continuous barking can mean several things like a house fire or an intruder in the house. The owner gets a notification on the mobile phone when the dog starts barking and the owner can start webcam to monitor the situation
Goal: A device will be build using a raspberry pi, USB webcam, and sound sensor with the following features:
    • dispense a treat to dogs via the Android app or set regular intervals for treat dispense.
    • Barking Alert
    • Live stream video to monitor the pet
Technology Stack: Android Studio, Raspberry Pi, Remaining TBD
Project Proposal #2
Tite: Predicting Restaurant's success using Machine Learning Techniques
Project Idea Description: Competition is growing day by day, and to compete in this world, you need to have some insights. As per the last 5 years stats, 60% of the restaurants didn't make it past their first year, and 80% of the restaurants closed down within 5 years. Due to this, the restaurant owners incur a huge amount of losses and inadvertently the banks who lend money to such restaurants lose money. So to avoid this, the proposed system would predict the success rate of the restaurant based on certain features such as the location, cuisine, footfall in that area and many more.
Goal: The prediction system will predict the success of the restaurant which will aid the restaurant owners as well as the banks. Suggestions to make the restaurant more successful based on the previous data will be provided as well. And recent trends of restaurants failing/succeeding will be an add on.
Technology Stack: Tensorflow, sci-kit learn, Remaining TBD.
Project Proposal #3
Title: Glaucoma detection using Deep learning techniques
Project Idea Description: Nearly 2.7 million people have been affected by Glaucoma, making it one of the leading cause for blindness in the world. It's frighteningly irrevocable progress makes early diagnosis a necessity. Often the scarcity of experts in developing nations or rural areas may lead to delayed diagnosis and ultimately vision loss. Considering the vast amount of image data available in ophthalmology, medical image analytics can help in early and accurate diagnosis of Glaucoma like eye diseases. The proposed system will use deep learning techniques to detect Glaucoma by taking Retinal fundus images as input. The biological marker like Blood vessels, microaneurysms, and exudates present in fundus image can aid in the diagnosis procedure.
Goal: The automated system will aid the medical staff in prescreening of retinal images. The patients affected with the disease then will be prioritized for the treatment. The computer-aided prescreening will result in an efficient and early detection, lessening the burden of an ophthalmologist.
Technology Stack: TensorFlow, Remaining TBD
