Project Proposal #1

Title: Automated pet surveillance

Project idea Description: The common problem that every dog owner faces is how to take care of their dog pets while they are not home. Most of the times the dogs start showing anxiety issues when they have left home alone and tend to show abnormal behaviors like chewing furniture, continuous barking, etc. The proposed device will help the dog owners to keep an activity track on their pet remotely via webcam and feed them by just clicking a button or setting regular intervals for food dispense. The device will send the notifications to the owner whenever the dog behaves abnormally. Abnormal behaviors like continuous barking can mean several things like a house fire or an intruder in the house. The owner gets a notification on the mobile phone when the dog starts barking and the owner can start webcam to monitor the situation

Goal: A device will be build using a raspberry pi, USB webcam, and sound sensor with the following features:
    • dispense a treat to dogs via the Android app or set regular intervals for treat dispense.
    • Barking Alert
    • Live stream video to monitor the pet

Technology Stack: Android Studio, Raspberry Pi, Qwe
